Hi! I'm Dr. Dana Wortman, an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs in Game Design and Development and Computer Science. I've been teaching and doing research for over 21 years.

I'm currently working on research in Visualization, Artificial Intelligence, Game Design and Development, and Education.

I'm working on several Unity certifications.

I'm looking to collaborate on AI applications, predominantly in the education space.
